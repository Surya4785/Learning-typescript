# Learning-TypeScript

A repository for exploring and learning the fundamentals of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

## 🧠 What’s this about?

This repo is a learning sandbox for me (student at ABES Engineering College) to play around with TypeScript concepts, build small examples, and gradually build up my understanding of typed JavaScript.  
I’m working through topics such as basic types, type inference, configuration, and more advanced features.

## 📂 Project structure


## ✅ What you’ll find

- Basic types and their usage in TypeScript.  
- How to set up a `tsconfig.json` and build a TS project.  
- Examples of type inference, union types, interfaces, generics (added over time).  
- Small experiments and code snippets to solidify the concepts.  
- Comments and notes to help me remember what I learned.

## 🚀 Getting started

To run the code locally:

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Surya4785/Learning-typescript.git
   cd Learning-typescript

📌 How you can contribute / collaborate

If you find an error in an example, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request (PR).

If you’d like to add a new topic folder (e.g., “Generics”, “Decorators”, “Advanced Types”), you’re welcome to fork and submit.

Keep things simple, readable and easy to follow — the goal is clarity and learning, not production-level complexity.
